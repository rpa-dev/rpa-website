    For the coming year, children need to reach the appropriate age by September 30, 2020. While 2’s are not expected to be potty trained, the school wants to be full partners for students in the process. Students in the 3’s classes are expected to be potty trained since classrooms are not set-up to change diapers. If medical reasons preclude a child then the school will work with the student. Once a student is accepted at the school, as long as yearly registration deadlines are met, placement for the following year is guaranteed.
