    For the coming year, children need to reach the appropriate age by September
    30, 2020. While 2’s are not expected to be potty trained, the school wants
    to be full partners for students in the process. Students in the 3’s classes
    are expected to be potty trained since classrooms are not set-up to change
    diapers. If medical reasons preclude a child then the school will work with
    the student. Once a student is accepted at the school, as long as yearly
    registration deadlines are met, placement for the following year is
    guaranteed.
