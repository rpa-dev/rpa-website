      Great Arlington preschool. Our kids (2 and 4) love their teachers and the
      welcoming, engaging environment. We find the enrichment classes offered
      fantastic as well. (Spanish, Music, Sign Language & Movement). Ms. Martha,
      the school director is great. I would definitely recommend, although apply
      early as it is competitive to gain admission (like most Arlington
      preschools).

On both dates, we will start with an information session about the school and the registration process. We will then proceed to visit all of the classroom areas. On Thursday, the Director will conduct the session and classes will be visited. On Tuesday, a teacher and current parent will also be present, but classes will not be in session. Forms will be available at both sessions. Parents are welcome to attend a tour but are not required to do so in order to submit an application.

**All forms and envelopes need to be submitted no later than January 30, 2020 at 1pm in order to be included in the lottery for class openings.**

Please make childcare arrangements for your children during the time you desire to visit.

For your convenience, a downloadable PDF version of the registration form is available below. Click to view, save, and print the registration form.
