      Great Arlington preschool. Our kids (2 and 4) love their teachers and the
      welcoming, engaging environment. We find the enrichment classes offered
      fantastic as well. (Spanish, Music, Sign Language & Movement). Ms. Martha,
      the school director is great. I would definitely recommend, although apply
      early as it is competitive to gain admission (like most Arlington
      preschools).

On both dates, we will start with an information session about the school and the registration process. We will then discuss the COVID Protocols in Place for the Upcoming School Year.

**All forms and envelopes need to be submitted no later than Monday, April 12, 2021 at 1pm in order to be included in the lottery for class openings.**

**Please email the Director directly at [rlwp@copper.net](mailto:rlwp@copper.net) for a set of enrollment/registration forms for your child/ren. The Director will send each family the information ASAP to start the enrollment/registration process. A spot is NOT reserved until we have received all of the necessary paperwork and payment in the mail for your family as spots are very limited.**

Please call ([703.538.6232](tel:+17035386232)) or email ([rwlp@copper.net](rwlp@copper.net)) if any questions. If leaving a message, please leave your name, phone number and the age of your child.
