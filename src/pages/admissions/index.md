      Great Arlington preschool. Our kids (2 and 4) love their teachers and the
      welcoming, engaging environment. We find the enrichment classes offered
      fantastic as well. (Spanish, Music, Sign Language & Movement). Ms. Martha,
      the school director is great. I would definitely recommend, although apply
      early as it is competitive to gain admission (like most Arlington
      preschools).
