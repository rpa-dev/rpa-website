      Great Arlington preschool. Our kids (2 and 4) love their teachers and the
      welcoming, engaging environment. We find the enrichment classes offered
      fantastic as well. (Spanish, Music, Sign Language & Movement). Ms. Martha,
      the school director is great. I would definitely recommend, although apply
      early as it is competitive to gain admission (like most Arlington
      preschools).

**Registration Process**

**All forms and envelopes need to be submitted ASAP in order to be included in the lottery for class openings if there is not a current space available. If space is available it is on a first come, first served basis due to COVID at this time.**

**Please email the Director directly at [rlwp@copper.net](mailto:rlwp@copper.net) for a set of enrollment/registration forms for your child/ren. The Director will send each family the information ASAP to start the enrollment/registration process. A spot is NOT reserved until we have received all of the necessary paperwork and payment in the mail for your family as spots are very limited.**

Please call ([703.538.6232](tel:+17035386232)) or email ([rwlp@copper.net](rwlp@copper.net)) if any questions. If leaving a message, please leave your name, phone number and the age of your child.
