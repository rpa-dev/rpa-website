It is with great sadness that RLWP has come to the decision to remain closed for the upcoming 2021-2022 preschool year due to low enrollment numbers. We truly have enjoyed being a fixture in Northern VA for over the past 20 years providing preschool services to many children and families. We wish your family all the best with your preschool search. Should your family need immediate attention, please feel free to email us at rlwpcochairs@gmail.com and we will respond asap.
