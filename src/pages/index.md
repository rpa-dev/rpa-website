      We have attended this preschool for 7 years with my third child there now.
      We have had such an amazing experience. The teachers have taught my kids
      so much about kindness and caring, while giving them a great educational
      experience. My older kids were more than ready for Kindergarten and still
      love going back to see their teachers, with their younger sister.

    It is with sadness that RLWP will not be re-opening its doors for the
    upcoming 2021-2022 Preschool Year. After careful consideration and low
    enrollment numbers, RLWP will not be able to re-open for the upcoming school
    year. We wish families all the best with your search for a preschool program
    to meet your families needs for the upcoming year.

  Enriching childrenâ€™s lives through play-based learning since 1997, RLWP is a
  part time, 2-5 year old mixed-aged group and play-based early learning
  experience. Welcoming classrooms and playgrounds, teachers, enrichment classes
  on age-appropriate subjects, and off-site field trips (when available) combine
  to provide a special learning experience, to create and foster a love of
  learning in your child.
