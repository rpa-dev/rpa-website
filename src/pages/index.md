      We have attended this preschool for 7 years with my third child there now.
      We have had such an amazing experience. The teachers have taught my kids
      so much about kindness and caring, while giving them a great educational
      experience. My older kids were more than ready for Kindergarten and still
      love going back to see their teachers, with their younger sister.

    Our Preschool is based on a mixed-age group model. This is the model we have
    chosen to follow to have each child's learning based on where they are and
    to help them grow throughout the school year. We find that having a
    mixed-age group model is a great way for our older student learners to help
    the younger student learners through example and hands-on experiences. This
    also teachers the older students great leadership skills which they will
    take as they embark into Kindergarten and on. Classes for the 2’s are held 2
    days per week on Tuesday and Thursday from 9:15 am - 12:00 noon. The 3’s
    classes are held Monday through Thursday from 9:15 am – 12:00 noon. There is
    an optional lunch program for these groups as well. This program runs 12
    noon – 1 pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. The 4’s class
    meets Mondays from 9:15 am – 12:00 noon and Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
    Thursdays from 9:15 am – 1:00 pm. The school is not open on Fridays. ;;2's
